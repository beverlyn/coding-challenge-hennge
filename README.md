# HENNGE Coding Challenge

## Description
For this challenge, we were provided with the base code for an email auditing system. One of the component files was left blank for us to implement our solution.

The specifics and rules of the coding challenge are provided under [CHALLENGE.md](https://github.com/beverlyn/coding-challenge-hennge/blob/main/CHALLENGE.md)

Further instructions are provided under [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/beverlyn/coding-challenge-hennge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Solution
My solution to the coding challenge is implemented in [RecipientsDisplay.vue](https://github.com/beverlyn/coding-challenge-hennge/blob/main/src/components/RecipientsDisplay.vue)

Usually, for cleaner code, I'd include the minimum amount of comments to explain certain parts. I also try to implement self documenting code.

But for the purpose of this challenge, I added many comments to thoroughly explain my thought procress, and to provide detailed documentation.
